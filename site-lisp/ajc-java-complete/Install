;; 1. generate the tag file .
;;
;;     Tags.java use JDK reflection to generate a tag file by
;;     loading all class in classpath ,what you need to do is
;;     just add your jars to $CLASSPATH.  now it is easy to use 
;;     Tags.java .
;;     suppose you put all you jar files in /path/to/jars/
;;     even in subdirectory of this directory
;;     and you put  all class files are in /project/WEB-INF/classes/
;;     then you can
;;     export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/path/to/jars/:/project/WEB-INF/classes/
;;     or 
;;     export CLASSPATH=$JAVA_HOME:/path/to/jars/:/project/WEB-INF/classes/
;;     this even  will tag all jars in $JAVA_HOME.
;;     it need about 3~10 min depending on the count of jars.
;;     during it ,you may see some exceptions ,if it don't kill
;;     the program ,just ignore it .
;;     run 
;;                 javac Tags.java 
;;                 java  Tags
;;     maybe you need :
;;                 java  -XX:MaxPermSize=512m  Tags
;;
;;     to generate the tag file ~/.java_base.tag 
;;     or
;;                 java  Tags com.yourcompanyname.*
;;
;;     it would only tag those class whose name is starts with
;;     com.yourcompanyname.
;;
;;     if it can't work on you computer ,use my tag file
;;     java_base.tag.bz2, just uncompress and rename it to
;;     .java_base.tag and put it in your home directory.
;;     of course you can change the name by customing
;;                 `ajc-tag-file'
;;     sometimes AJC can't find the tag file on
;;     windows for its ugly path like
;;     'C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator'
;;     you'd bettte custom 'ajc-tag-file'  on windows


;;  2. you should have installed  auto-complete and yasnippet.
;;     about how to install and config them ,you should find
;;     it on the net.
;;     after installed auto-complete ,you should do some
;;       patch on auto-complete-1.3/popup.el
;;       tow choice :
;;        1. put the ajc-java-complete/popup.el into auto-complete-1.3/
;;           (recommand)
;;        2. cd auto-complete-1.3/
;;           patch -p0 <popup-patch.diff
;;        and don't forget to byte compile it. 

;;  3. then  add this lines  in .emacs

;;       (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/ajc-java-complete/")
;;       (require 'ajc-java-complete-config)
;;       (add-hook 'java-mode-hook 'ajc-java-complete-mode)
;;       (add-hook 'find-file-hook 'ajc-4-jsp-find-file-hook)
;;       read ajc-java-complete-config.el  for more info .


;;     restart your emacs ,and enjoy.
